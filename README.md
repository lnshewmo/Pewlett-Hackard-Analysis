# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The HR department at Pewlett-Hackard is anticipating a 'silver tsunami' where a large volume of employees become eligible for retirement at the same time.  An initiative is being proposed to soften the exodus and resulting loss of historical knowledge by retaining certain retirement-eligible employees on a part-time basis to mentor new hires.  Queries were run on the 6 avaiable .csv files containing employee data to evaluate the scope of the tsunami, which departments and job titles will be impacted the most, and identify individuals who could be retained as mentors.
